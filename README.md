Abstract:

Building an end-to-end speech recognition system involves the development of a model capable of transcribing spoken language into written text without the need for traditional intermediate steps such as feature extraction, phoneme recognition, or language modeling. This approach leverages deep learning techniques, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs), to directly map audio inputs to textual outputs. The system integrates several components including acoustic models, language models, and decoding mechanisms into a unified architecture, often powered by sequence-to-sequence frameworks with attention mechanisms. By training on large datasets of spoken language, the model learns to handle various speech nuances such as accents, noise, and different speaking styles. The ultimate goal is to enhance transcription accuracy, reduce latency, and improve robustness, making speech recognition systems more accessible and applicable in diverse real-world applications such as virtual assistants, transcription services, and voice-controlled systems. This paper discusses the challenges, methodologies, and potential improvements for building such a system, with an emphasis on optimizing performance and scalability in practical settings.
